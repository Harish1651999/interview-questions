`display: none;` and `visibility: hidden;` are both CSS properties used to hide elements, but they have some key differences:

1. **Visibility**:

   - `display: none;`: This property removes the element from the document flow entirely. It's as if the element doesn't exist on the page. The element will not take up any space, and its dimensions won't affect other elements.
   - `visibility: hidden;`: This property hides the element while still occupying the space it would normally take up. It's as if the element is invisible but still there. Other elements are still affected by its dimensions, and it still takes up space on the page.

2. **Effect on Child Elements**:

   - `display: none;`: Child elements are also hidden, and they won't be rendered.
   - `visibility: hidden;`: Child elements remain visible unless their own visibility is also explicitly set to `hidden`.

3. **Event Handling**:

   - `display: none;`: The element is removed from the document, and any event listeners attached to it are also removed.
   - `visibility: hidden;`: The element remains in the document, and event listeners remain intact.

4. **Performance**:
   - `display: none;`: It might be more efficient for rendering performance because the browser doesn't need to render or layout the hidden element and its children.
   - `visibility: hidden;`: The browser still renders and lays out the element and its children, even though they are not visible, so it might have slightly more performance overhead compared to `display: none;`.

Choose between `display: none;` and `visibility: hidden;` based on your specific use case and requirements. If you want to completely remove an element from the layout and don't want it to take up any space, use `display: none;`. If you want the element to remain in the layout but be invisible, use `visibility: hidden;`.

Event handling in JavaScript involves listening for events triggered by user interactions or other sources (such as timers or network requests) and executing appropriate code in response to those events. Here's a basic overview of event handling in JavaScript:

#################################################

1. **Event Listeners**: You can attach event listeners to DOM elements using the `addEventListener()` method. This method takes two arguments: the type of event to listen for (e.g., "click", "mouseover", "keydown") and a callback function that will be executed when the event occurs.

   ```javascript
   const button = document.getElementById("myButton");
   button.addEventListener("click", function () {
     console.log("Button clicked!");
   });
   ```

2. **Event Object**: When an event occurs, an event object is automatically passed to the event handler function. This object contains information about the event, such as the type of event, the target element that triggered the event, and any additional data specific to the event type.

   ```javascript
   button.addEventListener("click", function (event) {
     console.log("Button clicked!");
     console.log("Target element:", event.target);
   });
   ```

3. **Event Propagation**: Events in JavaScript propagate through the DOM tree in two phases: capturing phase and bubbling phase. You can control the order of event handling by specifying the third parameter of `addEventListener()` as `true` (capture phase) or `false` (bubbling phase).

   ```javascript
   button.addEventListener(
     "click",
     function (event) {
       console.log("Button clicked!");
     },
     true
   ); // Use capture phase
   ```

4. **Removing Event Listeners**: You can remove event listeners using the `removeEventListener()` method, passing the same event type and callback function that was used to add the listener.

   ```javascript
   function handleClick(event) {
     console.log("Button clicked!");
   }

   button.addEventListener("click", handleClick);

   // Remove the event listener
   button.removeEventListener("click", handleClick);
   ```

5. **Event Delegation**: Event delegation is a technique where you attach a single event listener to a parent element rather than multiple event listeners to individual child elements. This can be useful when you have dynamically added or removed elements.

   ```javascript
   const parentElement = document.getElementById("parent");

   parentElement.addEventListener("click", function (event) {
     if (event.target.classList.contains("child")) {
       console.log("Child element clicked!");
     }
   });
   ```

Event handling is a fundamental part of building interactive web applications in JavaScript, allowing you to respond to user actions and create dynamic and engaging user experiences.

`splice()` and `slice()` are both array methods in JavaScript, but they serve different purposes:

1. **splice()**:

   - `splice()` is used to change the contents of an array by removing or replacing existing elements and/or adding new elements in place.
   - It takes three parameters: `start`, `deleteCount`, and optionally, `item1`, `item2`, ..., `itemN`.
   - `start`: The index at which to start changing the array.
   - `deleteCount`: The number of elements to remove from the array, starting at the `start` index. If set to 0, no elements are removed.
   - `item1`, `item2`, ..., `itemN`: Elements to add to the array at the `start` index. If no elements are specified, `splice()` only removes elements.
   - This method modifies the original array.

   ```javascript
   const array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
   array.splice(2, 1); // Removes one element starting at index 2
   console.log(array); // Output: [1, 2, 4, 5]

   array.splice(1, 2, "a", "b", "c"); // Removes two elements starting at index 1 and adds 'a', 'b', 'c'
   console.log(array); // Output: [1, 'a', 'b', 'c', 4, 5]
   ```

2. **slice()**:

   - `slice()` returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array into a new array object selected from `start` to `end` (end not included) where `start` and `end` represent the index of items in that array.
   - It takes two parameters: `start` and `end`.
   - `start`: The index at which to begin extraction. If negative, it specifies an offset from the end of the array.
   - `end`: The index at which to end extraction (not included). If omitted, `slice()` extracts to the end of the array.
   - This method does not modify the original array.

   ```javascript
   const array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
   const newArray = array.slice(1, 4); // Returns a new array containing elements from index 1 to 3 (not including 4)
   console.log(newArray); // Output: [2, 3, 4]

   const subArray = array.slice(2); // Returns a new array containing elements from index 2 to the end
   console.log(subArray); // Output: [3, 4, 5]
   ```

In summary, `splice()` is used to modify the original array by adding, removing, or replacing elements, while `slice()` is used to create a new array containing a portion of the original array without modifying it.
